# ChallengeWk10-LogoMaker

## Description

The logo maker is an interactable program that creates a logo with the specified text, colors, and shape picked by the user. The reason for making this project, is for a seamless, clean way of creating a basic SVG logo. The program works by running in the NodeJS terminal, and prompting users for criterias to enter, then is saved in the 'Logos' file.

## Usage 

The program works by calling the index.js file with node in the terminal window to start the file. Upon start, the terminal displays a "LOGO MAKER" text writing and prompts user to enter (up to) 3 characters.
When the user hits enter on the text for their logo, they will then enter a color to use for the text. Afterwards, there is a list of shapes that the user can scroll through with using the arrow keys on the keyboard to select either Circle, Square, or Triangle to use as the background for their logo. Once the user selects which shape they would like, they are finally prompted to enter a color for the background shape. Once the user answers all prompted questions, a message will display saying that the logo is created and saved into the "Logos" folder in the project folder.
